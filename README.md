# Naive Lane Detection

The goal of this project was to detect the current lane the vehicle is driving on by using its forward facing camera and classic computer vision techniques in OpenCV. The result is BAD, but in the process of completing this project you lay the foundation for the field of classic computer vision. Run it by:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
